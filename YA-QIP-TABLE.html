- Develop a goals strengths sheet for each child prior to their transition into the next room. Families will be invited to contribute through a newsletter. The new goals sheet will include the SSE logo. While we currently engage families in conversations verbally, this approach will provide a more formal, documented format. This process will be followed up with a developmental checklist, linking goals to relevant frameworks and outcomes

Goal 2 
Quality Area 2 - Health and Safety</td><td>Dietary &amp; Allergies</td><td>Enhance mealtime practices to provide opportunities for children to exercise agency and independence, while promoting inclusive approaches that respect individual allergy and dietary needs</td><td>- New signs have been ordered for all rooms, clearly indicating “EGG FREE” and “NUT AWARE.”
- We have implemented medical spreadsheets in each room and the staff area.
- An email has been sent to all families and staff seeking feedback on whether to revise our policies to be entirely egg and nut-free or to remain nut-aware.
- Procedures have been reviewed to enhance our safety protocols.
- A staff meeting has been scheduled for further training for all educators.
- We have gone over the notes from the day of the incident and the follow-up conversations had the next day, and we have used these insights to make changes to our procedures for any medical incident.
- After feedback from families and discussion with educators at our staff meeting, we decided to be egg aware and have talked about the importance of clear communication, signs hung in visual areas and procedures for when not eating inside at set C6 
-A8Discussion in regards to inclusiveness was also had as children with allergies sit at set station with their photos on the desk, we reflected this is a learning opportunity and as a class we discuss allergies and how we can help keep our friends safe, if only one child is in with an allergy we will allow them to sit with the entire class but with an educator next to them to make sure the meal time is safe and supported.

Staffing Arrangements</td><td>Increase Qualificed Educators </td><td>Previously, our service operated under a staffing model that required waivers due to difficulty in hiring qualified Early Childhood Teachers (ECTs). This strained our ability to maintain a flexible and supportive roster, resulting in challenges for both our educators and the quality of interactions with children</td><td>•	As the new Approved Provider, I have successfully hired 4 Early Childhood Teachers (ECTs) and 2 Diploma-qualified educators. This significant addition to our team has facilitated a more robust staffing structure
- The new hires allow for a more flexible roster, which supports the well-being and professional development of our educators.
- With adequate staffing, we can provide our educators with more time for growth, fostering quality interactions and individualised attention for children.
- The increase in qualified staff enhances the quality of education, ensuring that children&#39;s needs are met more effectively.
Continue to:
•	Monitor and Evaluate: We will monitor the effectiveness of the new staffing arrangements and gather feedback from educators and families to assess improvements in quality and engagement.
•	Professional Development: Ongoing professional development will be provided to all staff to ensure they are supported in their roles and are continually enhancing their skills and knowledge.

Staffing Arrangements</td><td>Improved induction process</td><td>Induction processes have traditionally involved an overload of information and extensive paperwork, which can be overwhelming for new educators. In the past, hiring during busy periods led to new staff needing to &quot;hit the ground running,&quot; which compromised the quality of their induction experience. To address these challenges, we aim to streamline our induction processes by reducing paperwork and incorporating a more hands-on approach</td><td> - 
January 2026 - Trial less paerwork with new staff startign 
Decrease the amount of paperwork by creating engaging induction videos that cover essential information, allowing new staff to understand key processes without being inundated with documents
- 	Shift toward a more interactive induction experience. By using videos, we can create a combination of visual and practical learning that will help ease the transition for new staff.
- 	Where possible, arrange for new educators to complete their induction off the floor during their first shift. This approach allows for a more calm and focused induction experience, providing them with the time needed for connection and communication with their peers and mentors before having to start the day on the floor engaging with children
-  Develop a series of instructional videos covering key topics, ensuring new educators have visual resources to refer back to when needed.
- Create a structured schedule for the first shift that includes dedicated time for orientation tasks, relationship-building activities with existing staff, and discussions about expectations
- Establish a process for new educators to give feedback on their induction experience, helping us to identify ongoing challenges and areas for further improvement
- Organise regular check-ins during new staff&#39;s initial months to discuss their experiences, address any concerns, and provide ongoing support.</td><td>45839</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>34a750a9-644f-46b5-8f1c-09cfb2b996f5</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>83e74b0e-d47f-413f-ae68-8d31f0a88bb2</td><td>Goal 5
